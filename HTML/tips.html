    Dark Age is arguably the most important stage of the game. How you do in the Dark Age will determine how much your economy grows further into the game.<br>
    The key is to keep creating villagers and advance to Feudal Age as fast as possible with as much villagers as possible. Too late and your opponent may rush
    you easily. Too early and you may have too few villagers to quickly upgrade to Castle Age.
    The right number of villagers depends upon your strategy in the later part of the game but the beginning is pretty standard.<br>
    You start with three villagers, one Scout and one Town Center. Quickly select your Town Center and queue villagers with all the food you have. Send sheep, if any found, to the Town Center. Use two of your villagers to build a house and the third to build another house. Select your Scout and start looking for more sheep, boars, potential choke points and your nearest forest. While your scout does this, your villagers must constantly eat sheep. Create a villager as soon as you see 50 food in your resources. Never let your Town Center be idle.
