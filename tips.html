<div id="top">This page takes you through one of the various strategies employed by players, the Knight Rush, or the Krush. We're chose this strategy
                  because it is one of the easiest strategies to pull off.</div>

<!-- <div id="tip">

    Dark Age is arguably the most important stage of the game. How you do in the Dark Age will determine how much your economy grows further into the game.<br>
    The key is to keep creating villagers and advance to Feudal Age as fast as possible with as much villagers as possible. Too late and your opponent may rush
    you easily. Too early and you may have too few villagers to quickly upgrade to Castle Age.
    The right number of villagers depends upon your strategy in the later part of the game but the beginning is pretty standard.<br>
    You start with three villagers, one Scout and one Town Center. Quickly select your Town Center and queue villagers with all the food you have. Send sheep, if any found, to the Town Center. Use two of your villagers to build a house and the third to build another house. Select your Scout and start looking for more sheep, boars, potential choke points and your nearest forest. While your scout does this, your villagers must constantly eat sheep. Create a villager as soon as you see 50 food in your resources. Never let your Town Center be idle.

  <h2>Fast Castle Build</h2>
  <form action="search.php" method="post">
    This build order considers that you have 2 boars and 4 deers. You may want to change the build order a bit if you are playing Huns, Teutons, Mongols or China to take advantage of their bonuses.<br><br>

<b>BUILD ORDER:</b><br><br>

Game starts<br><br>

    Put 2 vills on one house and 1 vill on one house. Build two houses. Use scout to find sheep. When you find sheep, send two to TC and other two to scout. [If you're playing China (1.0c or 1.0e patch), build the house a bit later. Focus on getting enough food first].
    Once the houses are build, send these villagers to sheep.<br><br>

    Next few villagers go like this:<br>
    Sheep<br>
    Sheep<br>
    Sheep<br>

    You now have 6 villagers on Sheep<br><br>


    Lumber camp - > Lumberjack<br>
    Wood<br>
    Wood<br>
    Boar<br>
    Wood [If you're playing huns, you don't really need 4 on wood, can do just 3]<br>
    Mill<br><br>

    Once the mill is built, use the villager who lured the boar and got injured to make a farm.<br><br>

    Mill<br>
    Mill<br>
    Mill<br>
    Boar<br><br>

    Again, use the injured villager to make a farm.<br><br>

    Wood [Second Lumber Camp]<br>
    Wood<br>
    Wood<br><br>

    Use two of the hunters to make two farms. (the boar must be getting over by now)<br><br>

    Wood<br>
    Wood [If you're playing Teutons, can do with one or two less on wood].<br><br>

    Build a Mining Camp<br><br>

    Gold<br>
    Gold<br>
    Gold<br><br>

    Age up with 26 villagers + 1 scout.<br><br>

        10 on Wood<br>
        3 on Gold<br>
        4 on Forage<br>
        3  Hunters on Deer<br>
        4 Farmers<br>
        2 on Sheep<br><br>

    During Age up to Feudal, use one villager to build a Barracks. If required, use another villager to build a few palaside walls.<br><br>

    When you reach Feudal Age, use four villagers (from wood, generally) to build a Stable (or a Archery Range, if you're going CA) and a Blacksmith (or a Market, if your team-mates aren't great with coordination and flaring).<br>
    Wood<br>
    Wood<br><br>

    The new villagers in Feudal Age went to wood (the trees near the TC).<br><br>

    Click Castle Age and research wood-cutting and mill upgrades. After clicking castle age, your villager distribution (Total 28 villagers) should be something like:<br>
    8 Farmers<br>
    13 Lumberjacks<br>
    4 Miners<br>
    3 Foragers (These will build Farms around the mill as soon as the forages get over)<br><br>

    Reach Castle Age around 16:20 or so. Can make knights from one stable. This is more of a boom-y buildup. During transition, you can move a few villagers from wood to gold and go two stables instead of one.<br><br><br>



<b>HOT-KEYS:</b><br><br>

    H- Go to Town Center<br>
    C- Create a Villager<br>
    Use control groups to hot-key your scout-cavalry, sheep-scout and hunters. You can scout more efficiently this way. I personally use Ctrl+1 for SC, Ctrl+2-4 for sheep and then Ctrl+4 for Hunters (A few sheep are already eaten by now).<br>
    S- Go to Stable<br>
    E- Create a Knight-line<br>
    R- Create a Scout-line<br>
    Q- Go to Barracks<br>
    E- Create a Militia-line<br>
    R- Create a Spear-man-line<br>
    W- Go to Archery Range<br>
    E- Create an Archer-line<br>
    R- Create a Skirmisher-line<br>
    C- Create a Cavalry-Archer line<br>
